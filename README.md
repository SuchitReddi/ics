# Intrusion Capture System
This IoT project uses a raspberry pi, a keypad and camera module connected to a server via mqtt. The camera sends a captured image if the input pin is wrong.

1) Run `bash setup.sh`.
2) Run `bash ics.sh` on control center (receiver) first, then on intruder capture system (authentication device).
