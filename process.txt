# Creating python virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv/

# Installing required libraries
venv/bin/pip3 install rpi-gpio
venv/bin/pip3 install paho-mqtt
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y && sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service

# I added the above requirements into setup.py. First run setup.py on both devices.

### YOU MUST RUN RECEIVE.PY FIRST AND WAIT RECEIVER DEVICE TO SUBSCRIBE. RUN NUMPAD.PY/SEND.PY ON PUBLISHING DEVICE ONLY THEN ###

### If you reconnect the camera in the middle and it says no camera module found, just reboot before panicking ###

###IMAGE SIZE CONSTRAINT###
The image should be roughly 50kb to be transmitted via MQTT. So, we had to resize the image captured using imagemagick.

#The capture, resize and automatic sending of image is included in numpad.py
sudo apt install imagemagick
convert -resize 10% intruder_captured.jpeg intruder_compressed.jpeg

##Process
-> Run receive.py on the receiving pi device.
-> Run numpad.py on the pi device connected to camera and keypad.

-> To check if received image is correct, run receive.py and send.py in alternate devices.
